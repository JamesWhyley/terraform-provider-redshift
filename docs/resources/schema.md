  A database contains one or more named schemas. Each schema in a database contains tables and other kinds of named objects. By default, a database has a single schema, which is named PUBLIC.

# redshift_schema (Resource)

A database contains one or more named schemas. Each schema in a database contains tables and other kinds of named objects. By default, a database has a single schema, which is named PUBLIC. You can use schemas to group database objects under a common name. Schemas are similar to file system directories, except that schemas cannot be nested.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "redshift_user" "owner" {
  name = "owner"
}

resource "redshift_schema" "schema" {
  name  = "my_schema"
  owner = redshift_user.owner.name
  quota = 150
}
```
